# Test Controller

## Design Considerations
I've decided to rewrite this code in Typescript (due to its readability and it takes advantage of features in ES+). As a result, I've refactored this code in typescript, and compiled it to native JS. 

## Installation of Dev Env
1. Install node and npm 
2. Navigate to project directory and enter in command line `npm run build`
